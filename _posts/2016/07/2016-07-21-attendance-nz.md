By Tom Kelly, PhD Candidate in Genetics (University of Otago). Thoughts my own and not those of my institution.

The following is based on my experiences at:

Research bazaar 2015 [University of Melboure](http://unimelb.edu.au)

SWC Feb 2015 at [University of Canterbury (UC)](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/)

SWC Otago June 2015, ResBaz 2016 Dunedin, DC Otago Feb 2016, SWC Otago June 2016 at the [University of Otago (UO))](http://www.otago.ac.nz/)

The events were supported by the New Zealand eScience Institute ([NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)).

###Main point

Over the course of several workshops we've had minor problems with "no-shows" (people signing up and not attending) or "drop-offs" (people not returning for future days or sessions). This has lead to discussions about how we may address this to ensure that others who would have attended for the entire workshop do not miss out on places.

###Motivation

At our most recent workshop in [Dunedin](https://mikblack.github.io/2016-06-29-Otago/) we had 21/25 attendees who signed up attending. At previous workshops this had also been a minor issue, being as high as 25% in Christchurch (Feb 2015), this contrasted starkly with the overbooked "Research Bazaar" event in Melbourne following our training. However, Bill Mills (visiting from Canada) was not concerned: they usually have 25-30% no show in US/Canada so our attendance figures are pretty good compared to other free Software Carpentry events. 

###Registration Fee

We discussed no shows with Bill Mills when we were doing ResBaz/SWC in Melbourne and Christchurch. It wasn't a huge issue but he suggested a small fee to make sure those who register actually attend or cancel, noting "no show" numbers drop drastically when doing this. This was again raised by [NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/) following the latest [Dunedin](https://mikblack.github.io/2016-06-29-Otago/) workshop where sign-ups were lower than what we usually experience.

While we are still considering a small fee, there are complications with University regulations, particularly in attempting to run similar workshops across the country with [NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/). Some universities charge venue fees unless the event is free, run at cost, or for the benefit of staff and students. Another issue with charged events (even with a small fee) is that it may create disparity between research groups where some are funded from the lab and others need to foot the bill themselves due to financial or adminstrative constraints. Previously administrating the system has been an extra hurdle for us organising as well but with the ticking system through Eventbrite this burden on organisers is reduced.

Culturally, New Zealand is rather different to other places where ticketed events have been tried. We don't have tipping cutlure, the Warehouse (our equivalent of WallMart or Kmart) has the slogan "Where Everyone Gets a Bargain", and the Pak 'N' Save supermarket is proudly has "NZ lowest prices". These stores are widely successful, we have little concern for appearing cheap, particularly among the university student population. Many people here view a bargain or freebie positively, so I don't think the event is under-valued being free. It would be interesting to see if any other NZ sites have tried a paid ticketed event to boost attendance rates and how this compares to other countries.

###Departures over time

A larger concern to me is the number of participants who attend for the beginning of a multi-day workshop and do not return for the final sessions (particularly if it's Git compared more well-known Python or R lanaguages). While participants can't ethically be forced to attend all sessions if it doesn't work for them (thankfully, this is rare), many leaving midway can be difficult to address, particularly if they don't leave feedback on why. One issue we anticipated was that some participants may have to leave early for experimental work or childcare responsibilities so we tried splitting to shorter days across in our last [3 day workshop](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/07/otago-workshop.html). Another problem emerging is that some participants will be interested only in a particular session, such as biologists will just coming to R, even if we are encouraging them to attend the full course.

We note that we have done both ResBaz and Data Carpentry recently already and we pitched this last minute at largely the same community. Hopefully numbers pick up with a new influx of postgrad students next year and we could try wider promotion in advance now that most of our collaborators or department have had the opportunity to attend already (often getting early invites). A wider issue that we've been more concerned with is follow up: with such a large number of people having been through our workshops, another issue is providing community support and extension material (like Mozilla study group or research bazaar).

We aren't too concerned about our lower sign-up numbers this time around, at least no one missed out with no shows, generally we manage to let our waiting list in with cancellations anyway. It would be interesting to know if particular people (groups, or institutions) are signing up and not coming recurrently but a blacklist (as some SWC sites have done) may be overreacting if no one missed out a space yet.

###Catering

Another suggestion to raise numbers is catering to boost numbers (possibly funded by registration fees), which we have tried at Dunedin Research Bazaar last February. However, had issues with overcatering for those did not stay for lunch and we still had dwindling numbers by the last day. I think our "come back for day 3" rate was be higher this time with combined Git+Bash sessions on days 1 and 3. I'm afraid that some participants do still come only intending to R or Python but most seem to give the rest a shot.
