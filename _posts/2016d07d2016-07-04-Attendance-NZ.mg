ResBaz Melb / Dunedin
Otago

Hi team,

Bill Mills said they usually have 25-30% no show in US/Canada so 4/25 is pretty good. I have a hunch some biologists will just come to R, although the one's I talked to didn't sign up in case there weren't spaces.

Thanks for the reminder re. Social media, I beat you to it though :)

Good luck for R tomorrow!

Cheers,
Tom K

Hi Aleksandra,

Thanks for the pointers, I've also discussed no shows with Bill Mills when we're doing ResBaz/SWC in Melbourne and Christchurch. It wasn't a huge issue but he also suggested a small fee to make sure those who register actually attend or cancel. Unfortunately, I think Otago is "one of those universities" which waives quite hefty venue fees on the condition that we're a free (or non-profit) event... it's at least an administrative headache that we've decided against.

Culturally, Kiwis like a bargain or freebie (and there's little stigma for taking one even if you're wealthy) so I don't think the event is under-valued being free but it would be interesting to see if any other NZ sites have tried a paid ticketed event to boost attendance rates.

Catering is another great idea to boost numbers, although we still had dwindling numbers by the last day. I think our "come back for day 3" rate will be higher with the combined Git+Bash sessions. I'm also aware that some participants do come only intending to R or Python but most seem to give the rest a shot.

I wouldn't read too much into our lower sign-up numbers this time around, at least no one missed out with no shows, generally we manage to let our waiting list in with cancellations anyway. It would be interesting to know if particular people (groups, or institutions) are signing up and not coming recurrently but a blacklist may be overreacting if no one missed out a space yet.

We have done both ResBaz and Data Carpentry recently already and we pitched this last minute at largely the same community. Hopefully numbers pick up with a new influx of postgrad students next year and we could try wider promotion in advance now that most of our collaborators or department have had the opportunity to attend already (often getting early invites). I think the wider issue with such a large number of people having been through our workshops will be providing community support and extension material (like Mozilla study group or research bazaar).

As for social media, I haven't had a great deal of experience or success with it yet. It has been a fun time to chat about R online with the useR2016 conference at Stanford today and tomorrow too. Twitter isn't a big thing here, although I have also posted the sign-up link to a bunch of postgraduate / ECR community facebook pages. I'm happy to contribute towards a blog post, although it would likely draw from my experiences of SWC as a whole over 18-months rather than focusing on this workshop. Mostly because it's interesting to me to compare the workshops, they've differed drastically, particularly in how much the participants engage with the peripheral etherpad, twitter, and helper aspects of the SWC format. I'm new to the format though so any suggestions for scope, content, structure, audience would be helpful when we get around to that. Let's get the workshop done first and then look into that.

Cheers,
Tom K
